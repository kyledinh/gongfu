# Gongfu

With 2021 as a new start, I'm pruning my old repos. Gongfu was a project I created over 6 years ago. My way of putting new exciting things together like: Go 1.3, Vagrant, Gruntjs and Angular (some ancient number)! The project was a simple twitter clone to demostrate building a frontend and backend api in a VM. 

Many things have changed since then, and I can't see a benefit to follow any of these examples. And I would recommend following newer examples instead.
# Newer Examples to Follow

## Go 
* A Tour of Go (https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
* Effective Go (https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) 
* How to Write Go Code (https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
* Standard Go Project Layouts (https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

## Docker/Kubernetes

## Other Sample Repos
* Golang Source - (https://github.com/golang/go)
* Github Trending Repos - (https://github.com/trending/go)

I found it extremely useful reading the actual Go source code, to learn how things work and some standard idioms.
